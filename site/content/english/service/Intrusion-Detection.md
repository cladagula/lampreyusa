### Monitored Intrusion Detection

Lamprey Security Solutions specialists can design and implement an intrusion detection system that detects and deter activities that can harm your business and threaten your employees, 24/7.

> #### Perimeter
> Your business has several potential entry points, from doors to windows. Strategically placed sensors can quickly detect if someone is trying to break into your facility.

> #### Interior
> Thieves frequently break glass to enter the premises. Activation of the glass break sensor can cause the security system to send an alert to your mobile. In cases where the glass has not been broken, motion detectors can confirm that someone is moving within their location. and you can activate the cameras and see what is happening.
